  SmoothJS is a very light ES6 Vanilla JavaScript + SCSS written Carousel

# Installation

# Usage

# Development

`JavaScript`

Depending on the moment of time you are viewing the source code ES6 may or may not
be fully supported by all major browsers. As of this writing the project uses Babel and Gulp to compile the code
from ES6 to ES5.

If you are already using Babel or another ES6 compiler in your workflow grab the development (ES6) version.

`SASS (SCSS)`
